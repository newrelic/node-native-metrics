# Native Metrics for New Relic Node.js Agent

[![npm status badge][1]][2] [![native-metrics CI][ci-badge]][ci-link] [![codecov][3]][4]

This module provides hooks into the native layer of Node.js to provide metrics for
the [New Relic Node.js Agent][npm-newrelic]. It gathers information that isn't
available at the JS layer about the V8 virtual machine and the process health.
It comes packaged with the New Relic Agent since v2, and there is nothing that
needs to be done. For Agent v1 you need only to install the module alongside
[`newrelic`][npm-newrelic].

## Installation and Getting Started

Typically, most users use the version auto-installed by the agent.

In some cases, installing a specific version is ideal. For example, new features or major changes might be released via a major version update to this module, prior to inclusion in the main New Relic Node.js agent.

```
$ npm install --save @newrelic/native-metrics
```

Note that this is a native module and thus must be compiled to function.
Pre-built binaries are included in the package for the following platforms, across all LTS versions of Node.js:

+ Linux/amd64
+ Linux/arm64
+ macOS/arm64
+ Windows/x64
+ Windows/x86

If your system does not match the above matrix, you will need to have a compiler installed on the machine where this is to be
deployed. See [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp#installation)
for more information on compiling native addons.

If you prepare and package deployments on one machine and install them on
another, the two machines must have the same operating system and architecture.
If they are not, you will need to re-build the native module after deploying in
order to get the correct binaries.

During installation, the module will first attempt to locate a prebuilt binary for the target machine within its included list of prebuilt binaries. If that fails, it will attempt a standard [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp#installation) build. If you do not want to use prebuilt binary, or know that it will need to be built, you can force a build:

```sh
$ npm install @newrelic/native-metrics --build-from-source
```

For more information, please see the agent [installation guide][install-node] and [compatibility and requirements][compatibility].

## Usage

```js
var getMetricEmitter = require('@newrelic/native-metrics')

var emitter = getMetricEmitter()
if (emitter.gcEnabled) {
  setInterval(() => {
    var gcMetrics = emitter.getGCMetrics()
    for (var type in gcMetrics) {
      console.log('GC type name:', type)
      console.log('GC type id:', gcMetrics[type].typeId)
      console.log('GC metrics:', gcMetrics[type].metrics)
    }
  }, 1000)
}
if (emitter.usageEnabled) {
  emitter.on('usage', (usage) => console.log(usage))
}
if (emitter.loopEnabled) {
  setInterval(() => {
    var loopMetrics = emitter.getLoopMetrics()
    console.log('Total time:', loopMetrics.usage.total)
    console.log('Min time:', loopMetrics.usage.min)
    console.log('Max time:', loopMetrics.usage.max)
    console.log('Sum of squares:', loopMetrics.usage.sumOfSquares)
    console.log('Count:', loopMetrics.usage.count)
  }, 1000)
}
```

The metric emitter keeps a referenced timer running for its periodic sampling
events. For a graceful shutdown of the process call `NativeMetricEmitter#unbind`.

```js
getMetricEmitter().unbind() // Process will now close gracefully.
```

If you would like to change the period of the sampling, simply unbind and then
call `NativeMetricEmitter#bind` with the new period.

```js
var emitter = getMetricEmitter({timeout: 15000})
emitter.unbind()
emitter.bind(10000) // Samples will now fire once every 10 seconds.
```

## Testing

This module includes a list of unit and functional tests.  To run these tests, use the following command

    $ npm run test

You may also run individual test suites with the following commands

    $ npm run unit
    $ npm run integration
